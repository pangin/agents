Use the \`dump_catalog\` tool to get an index of the EventCatalog (${catalogPath}), then use your read, grep, and glob tools to trace this schema to the resources that depend on it.

1. Resolve which catalog resource this schema belongs to. The schema file is usually attached to a message (event, command, or query), but may belong to a service or domain.
2. If you can find the resource (e.g message/service/domain) the schema belong too, then you have the resource id and version in the markdown file.
3. With the resource id and version of the owner of the schema, you can grep and understand who is consuming this resouce. For example a service is a consumer if it "recieves" (in the frontmatter property) this schema resource (e.g OrderPlaced Event)
4. A resource (E.g service) that sends the message is the producer, not a consumer; focus on consumers that could break.
5. Return each affected consumer with its id, version, type, summary, owners, path relative to the catalog root, and a short reason explaining why it is affected.
6. Use the consumer summary and owners from the catalog front matter or the \`dump_catalog\` result. If a consumer has no summary, return an empty string. If it has no owners, return an empty owners array.
7. Return a useful Mermaid flowchart in \`diagram\`. Follow the Mermaid diagram conventions from your agent instructions. Use only real resource ids you found in the catalog. Use an empty string if you cannot resolve enough resources for a useful diagram.

If you cannot resolve the schema to a catalog resource, or it has no consumers, return an empty consumers array and an empty diagram. Do not invent resources; only report consumers you can find in the catalog.`;
